In this directory, you will find all the scripts I have created for my Shell Basics tasks:

1. 0-current_working_directory - prints the absolute path name of the current working directory
2. 1-listit - displays the contents list of the current directory
3. 2-bring_me_home - changes the working directory to the user's home directory
4. 3-listfiles - displays the current directory contents in long format
5. 4-listmorefiles - displays the current directory contents, including hidden files (starting with .) in long format
6. 5-listfilesdigitsonly - displays the current directory contents numerically with user and group IDs, along with hidden files and in long format
7. 6-firstdirectory - creates a directory named *my_first_directory* in the */tmp/* directory
8. 7-movethatfile - moves the file named *betty* from */tmp/* to */tmp/my_first_directory*
9. 8-firstdelete - deletes the file named *betty*
10. 9-firstdirdeletion - deletes the directory named *my_first_directory*
11. 10-back - changes the working directory to the previous one
12. 11-lists - lists all files (even the hidden ones) in the current directory, the parent of the working directory and the */boot/* directory (in this order), in long format
13. 12-file_type - prints the type of the file named *iamafile*. The file *iamafile* will be in the *tmp* directory when running the script
14. 13-symbolic_link - creates a symbolic link to /bin/ls, named *__ls__*. The symbolic link will be created in the current working directory
15. 14-copy_html - copies all the HTML files from the current working directory to the parent of the working directory, but only copies files that did not exist in the parent of the working directory or were newer than the versions in the parent of the working directory

**These scripts are part of the Advanced Tasks:**

16. 100-lets_move - moves all files beginning with an uppercase letter to the directory */tmp/u*
17. 101-clean_emacs - deletes all the files in the current working directory that end with the character: ~
