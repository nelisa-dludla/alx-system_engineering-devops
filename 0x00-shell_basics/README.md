In this directory, you will find all the scripts I have created for my Shell Basics tasks:

1. 0-current_working_directory - prints the absolute path name of the current working directory
2. 1-listit - displays the contents list of the current directory
3. 2-bring_me_home - changes the working directory to the user's home directory
4. 3-listfiles - displays the current directory contents in long format
5. 4-listmorefiles - displays the current directory contents, including hidden files (starting with .) in long format
6. 5-listfilesdigitsonly - displays the current directory contents numerically with user and group IDs, along with hidden files and in long format
7. 6-firstdirectory - creates a directory named *my_first_directory* in the */tmp/* directory
8. 7-movethatfile - moves the file named *betty* from */tmp/* to */tmp/my_first_directory*
9. 8-firstdelete - deletes the file named *betty*
